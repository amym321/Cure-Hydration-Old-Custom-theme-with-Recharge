Our formula has 4x the electrolytes of leading sports drinks but contains no added sugar or artificial ingredients. This scientifically balanced formula can be used to help combat dehydration caused by everyday activities including exercise, travel and drinking alcohol."}},"1545059744473":{"type":"Text","settings":{"question":"What is an Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)?","answer":"Oral Rehydration Solution is a formula used to prevent and treat dehydration. An exact ratio of glucose-to-sodium triggers the sodium glucose transporter mechanism in the body that helps to rapidly absorb water and electrolytes into the bloodstream. The formula was originally pioneered by the World Health Organization to help treat severe dehydration in people suffering from Cholera and saved over 50 million lives. ORS is considered to be significantly safer and just as effective as fluid replacement through an IV. This innovation in hydration science has over 50 years of research and is considered to be one of the greatest medical advances of the last century."}},"1545059762382":{"type":"Text","settings":{"question":"Why isn’t water enough on its own?","answer":"Don’t get us wrong – we love water. But water on its own is often not enough to properly rehydrate our bodies. Sweat loss, alcohol consumption, travel, and a variety of other factors can lead to electrolyte imbalances. These imbalances prevent our bodies from effectively absorbing water into our bloodstreams, leading to dehydration."}},"1545059769730":{"type":"Text","settings":{"question":"When should I drink Cure?","answer":"You should drink Cure whenever you expect to sweat or after you’re feeling the symptoms of dehydration (fatigue, headaches). If you’re doing strenuous exercise, you can drink Cure either before, during, or immediately after your workout. If you’re hoping to ward off a hangover, it’s best to drink Cure before you go to bed. Starting your day with Cure is also a great way to naturally energize!"}},"1591382192453":{"type":"Text","settings":{"question":"Why does Cure come in powder form and not liquid?","answer":"Cure is currently sold in powdered form to reduce our carbon footprint and provide customers with a portable hydration option.

Given the purity of ingredients and lack of additives, clumping sometimes occurs when the powder is exposed to heat or humidity.

Stevia leaf extract is born from the sweet leaves of the stevia plant and Monk Fruit is a vine-ripened fruit native to Asia that helps round out the flavor so that there is no bitter aftertaste.\n\nDespite the common misconception, stevia is not an artificial sweetener! In order to extract the natural sweetness of the stevia plant, its leaves are harvested, dried, and then steeped in hot water. The resulting extract mixture is then filtered, purified, and finally dried to create a crystalized extract which we use in our formula. Since stevia is much sweeter than sugar (about 200 times sweeter, in fact), we only need to use a very small amount in each serving of Cure."}},"1591383329480":{"type":"Text","settings":{"question":"What is “citric acid” and why do you use it?","answer":"Citric acid is found naturally in citrus fruits like lemons and limes, and it’s what gives them their tart, sour taste.
